Few details to keep in your mind to ensure a smooth day in PESU :-

- **ID Card is MANDATORY.** This is to ensure security in the campus. Don't sweat it too much. In a pinch, you can usually flash your PESU App profile to get in. But be warned: Security guards might not be as lenient. Be prepared to answer some questions and potentially cool your heels for a bit while they verify your identity through some other means. 

- To be eligible to write the final exams (ESAs), students must maintain a **minimum attendance of 75% in every subject**.

- **The use of mobile phones during class time is strictly prohibited.** Any student found using a mobile phone in class will have their phone confiscated. You won't get it back until the semester is over, but you can have your SIM card back right when it's taken.

- ***Please note that this is tentative and is subject to change. Ideally, the above B.Tech and Non B.Tech Time tables swap every semster.***

- While some faculties might be understanding and allow latecomers occasionally, it is crucial to be punctual for your classes. 

- There's 10 to 15-minute grace period only for the **first class of the day**, meaning you can arrive up to 8:55 am without penalty. However, after that, entry and attendance are at the faculty's discretion.

- Remember, this grace period disappears entirely after breaks, so punctuality is crucial for all other classes.

- On a separate note, class schedules can vary. Some classes might end earlier, at 1:45 pm or 4:00 pm depending on the day.

- **Wednesdays** are usually **half-days** for all branches.
