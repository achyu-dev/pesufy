### Notes

A good old-fashioned notebook will do the trick for taking notes! Don't worry about fancy supplies at first. The university will provide a 5-subject spiral notebook later on.

### For Assignments

You'll need a blue book (around â‚¹15-20) for assignments in each subject. These are typically purchased at the university bookstore.

### Calculator 

A basic scientific calculator is your best friend for calculations. 

**Pro Tip**: Programmable calculators are not allowed during exams, so stick to a standard model.

**Casio FX-991EX (Classwiz)**: This scientific calculator is a popular choice among students. It's not mandatory, but it's a great recommendation if you're looking for a specific model. It is also very useful during examinations
