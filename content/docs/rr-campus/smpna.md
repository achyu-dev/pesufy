## About Samarpana
Samarpana is a student initiative of PES University, that seeks to make our community aware of the price that we pay for our freedom and express our gratitude to those who put their lives on the line for us to lead peaceful lives. As the future generation, it is our responsibility to express our gratitude towards the efforts of those who have sacrificed their lives for the nation. We at Samarpana believe in spreading the joy of giving and every year we pay our tributes to them by conducting various fundraising events, the motive of which is to make the lives of martyrs' families a little more joyful.
