* *Total Credits Required*: To graduate, you'll need to accumulate a total of **160** credits.
* *Courses and Credits*: Your credits come from the courses you take throughout your program. These courses are typically assigned credit values of 5, 4, or 2.
* *Earning Credits*: You earn the full credit value of a course by passing the exam and achieving a grade in the range of **A to E**.
* *Failing Grades*: If you receive an **F** grade in a course, you won't earn any credits for that course.
* *No Partial Credits*: The system is **all-or-nothing**. You either earn the full credit value or none at all. There are no partial credits awarded.
* The number of credit hours per week is generally proportional to the credit value of the course.
    * 5-credit courses: Meet for 5 hours per week.
    * 4-credit courses: Meet for 4 hours per week.
    * 2-credit courses: Meet for 2 hours per week.

**Remember**: This is a general explanation.  It's always a good idea to consult with your faculty for specific details about your program's curriculum and credit requirements.

## Calcultion of GPA

Your GPA (Grade Point Average) reflects your overall academic performance. Here's a breakdown of how your grades in each course contribute to your GPA:

* **Internal Marks (50%)**: Your internal marks account for 50% of your final grade. This component is further divided into:
    * **ISA 1 & 2 (20 marks each, reduced from 40)**: Combined, the two ISAs now contribute a total of **40 marks**. 
    * **Assignments (10 marks)**: Assignments throughout the semester add up to **10 marks**.
* **External Marks (50%)**: The remaining 50% of your final grade comes from your ESA. This exam is worth a total of 100 marks, but only the scaled score (converted to a value out of 50) is considered for GPA calculation.
* **Calculating Your Final Grade**: The internal and external marks are combined to determine your final grade for the course. (50% Internal Marks + 50% External Marks = 100% Final Grade)
* **GPA**: Your final percentage grade is then converted to a letter grade based on the following scale:
    * S (90+): Superior
    * A (80-89): Excellent
    * B (70-79): Good
    * C (60-69): Average
    * D (50-59): Pass
    * F (Below 50): Fail
